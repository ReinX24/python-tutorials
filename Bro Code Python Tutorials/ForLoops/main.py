# for loops = execute a block of code a fixed number of time.
#             You can iterate over a range, string, sequence, etc.

# Print numbers from 1 to 10
# for x in range(1, 11):
#     print(x)

# Print the numbers from 10 to 1
# for x in reversed(range(1, 11)):
#     print(x)

# Count by 2's
# for x in range(1, 11, 2):
#     print(x)
# print('HAPPY NEW YEAR!')

# Iterating through a string
# credit_card = '1234-5678-9012-3456'
# for i in credit_card:
#     print(i)

# Count from 1 to 20
# for x in range(1, 21):
#     if x == 13:
        # skips over the current loop
        # continue
        # terminates the loop
        # break
    # else:
    #     print(x)
