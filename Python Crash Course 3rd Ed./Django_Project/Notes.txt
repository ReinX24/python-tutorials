# Creating a virtual environment for our Django project
This is so that our project will be contained in one environment which makes
our code base cleaner.

python3 -m venv ll_env

# Activating the virtual environment
We activate our virtual enviroment so that we can install packages that we
will need for our Django project.

source ll_env/bin/activate

To deactivate, we simply just type in 'deactivate' in the console.

# Installing Django
After we have created our virtual environment, we will now be installing
Django. Make sure that our virtual environment is running when we install
Django in our directory.

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install django

Remember, we can only run our Django project whenever our virtual environment
is activated.

# Creating a project
Creating a project within our virtual environment itself (. at the end means
that we create the project in the current directory).

django-admin startproject ll_project .

# Creating a database for our Django project

python3 manage.py migrate

# Viewing the project using the 'runserver' command

python3 manage.py runserver

To a different port if the default port is being used (8000), we can add the
port we want to use for our webserver by adding a port number at the end of
runserver.

python3 manage.py runserver 8001
