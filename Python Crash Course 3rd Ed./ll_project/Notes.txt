# Creating a virtual environment for our Django project
This is so that our project will be contained in one environment which makes
our code base cleaner.

python3 -m venv ll_env

# Activating the virtual environment
We activate our virtual enviroment so that we can install packages that we
will need for our Django project.

source ll_env/bin/activate

To deactivate, we simply just type in 'deactivate' in the console.

# Installing Django
After we have created our virtual environment, we will now be installing
Django. Make sure that our virtual environment is running when we install
Django in our directory.

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install django

Remember, we can only run our Django project whenever our virtual environment
is activated.

# Creating a project
Creating a project within our virtual environment itself (. at the end means
that we create the project in the current directory).

django-admin startproject ll_project .

# Creating a database for our Django project

python3 manage.py migrate

# Viewing the project using the 'runserver' command

python3 manage.py runserver

To a different port if the default port is being used (8000), we can add the
port we want to use for our webserver by adding a port number at the end of
runserver.

python3 manage.py runserver 8001

# Creating an app in our Django project
Activating our virtual environment and adding an app
source ll_env/bin/activate
python3 manage.py startapp learning_logs

# Adding our models to our database and applying this to our Django project
python3 manage.py makemigrations learning_logs
python3 manage.py migrate

# Adding a superuser to our project
python3 manage.py createsuperuser

# Looking at our stored models in our database and their records
python3 manage.py shell
from learning_logs.models import Topic
Topic.object.all()

# Getting all the Topic database records and iterating through them
topics = Topic.object.all()
for topic in topics:
	print(topic.id, topic)

# Output:
1 Chess
2 Rock Climbing

# Getting a topic by their id and accessing their attributes
t = Topic.objects.get(id=1)
t.text
t.date_added

# We can also see the entries related to a Topic record in our database
To access a foreign key relationship, we need to use the lowercase text
of the class, in this case entry, and followed by an underscore and the
word set.
t.entry_set.all();

# Using template filters to modify variables in our webpage (check topic.html).

# CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Token
When we look at the forms within our django apps, we can see than these forms
contain a {% csrf_token %} template within them. This is so that each session
that the user will have with the site will be unique, which in turn will prevent
any malicious attack that the website may encounter.

# No such column error
One of the errors that I have encountered is the 'No such column error'. To fix
this, I deleted my sqlite database and made a new one, this error may have been
caused by changing the variable names in our models.py file.

# Setting records already stored in the database to an existing user
python3 manage.py shell
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
User.objects.all() # see all created User accounts
for user in User.objects.all()
	print(user.username, user.id)

# Migrating the existing records in our database to an already existing user
python3 manage.py makemigrations learning_logs
1 # select first option
1 # select user id of 1
python3 manage.py migrate

After entering the command will prompt the user to select a fix, we will choose
1 where we will set all existing rows to a User. We will type in 1 again since we
will be assigning it to the first user, the superuser we have made to access the
admin commands.

# Checking if the existing records now refer to the user with an id of 1 (superuser)
from learning_logs.models import Topic
for topic in Topic.objects.all():
	print(topic, topic.owner)

This prints all the recorded Topic objects and prints their owners.

# Deleting all the recorded data in the database (not recommended)
python3 manage.py flush

Its a good practice to migrate data instead of deleting all recorded data in a 
database, only delete all data if you really want to delete all existing data in
our database.

# Installing django-bootstrap5 to style our Django projects
source ll_env/bin/activate
pip install django-bootstrap5
